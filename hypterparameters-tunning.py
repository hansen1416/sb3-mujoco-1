# Certainly! Hereâ€™s an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Optuna to tune the hyperparameters for a Stable Baselines3 algorithm:

import optuna
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.envs import DummyVecEnv


def objective(trial):
    # Define the hyperparameters to be tuned
    learning_rate = trial.suggest_loguniform("learning_rate", 1e-5, 1e-3)
    n_steps = trial.suggest_int("n_steps", 16, 2048, log=True)
    batch_size = trial.suggest_categorical("batch_size", [8, 16, 32, 64])

    # Create the environment
    env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: gym.make("CartPole-v1")])

    # Create the model with the suggested hyperparameters
    model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=0, learning_rate=learning_rate,
                n_steps=n_steps, batch_size=batch_size)

    # Train the model
    model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

    # Evaluate the model
    mean_reward, _ = evaluate_policy(model, env, n_eval_episodes=10)

    return mean_reward


# Create a study object and optimize the objective function
study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)

# Print the best hyperparameters and corresponding reward
best_params = study.best_params
best_reward = study.best_value
print(f"Best Hyperparameters: {best_params}")
print(f"Best Reward: {best_reward}")

# This code snippet demonstrates how to use Optuna to tune the hyperparameters for a Stable Baselines3 algorithm. The objective function defines the hyperparameters to be tuned using trial.suggest_* methods. The environment is created using DummyVecEnv, and the model is trained and evaluated using the suggested hyperparameters. Finally, the best hyperparameters and corresponding reward are printed.

# Please note that this is just an example code snippet. You may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the Stable Baselines3 algorithm you are using.

# For more information on Optuna and Stable Baselines3, you can refer to their respective documentation: 12.
